# Password Generator Project
## About the project
  For this project I wanted to create an application that started with a base of lowercase letters and let the user choose between an array of options to create a random password. Prior to this project my skills with javascript were shaky at best, I had a solid understanding of if statements but I wasnt too confident on arrays and the different methods for creating arrays. I went through a few prototype versions of this applications using different methods. At one point I was using prompt windows to have the user enter a "Y" or "N" response and then using a switch statement to convert those strings int boolean values. I couldnt make it work in time however and using confirm prompts ended up being cleaner and more simple.
